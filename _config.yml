    I'm a software engineer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
    My first contact with programming was at 18, at the university, and I have been doing it professionally since I was 24. 
    My main objective is to participate in challenging professional projects, 
    where I can not only show my knowledge and provide quality solutions 
    to existing problems or needs, but also grow professionally by learning  
    from my colleagues and using and exploring state-of-the-art technologies. 
    Hobbies: photography, football, electronic music, sci-fi, reading, running, astronomy.
