### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
First of all, it's not a programming language. It's rather just text, written with JavaScript object notation.
It's a data-interchange format. A syntax for storing and exchanging data. All JSON files are built on two structures:
* A collection of key-value pairs
* A list of values which it's generally called as an array.

### Key benefits
* Easy to read and write by humans
* Easy to create and process by computers
* "Self-describing"
* Language independent (Can be read and used as a data format by any programming language)
* Can easily be sent to and from a server

### Syntax rules
* Data is in name/value pairs
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects
* Square brackets hold arrays

### Structures 
Valid data types to use in JSON:
* String (It must be written in double quotes)
* Number
* Object
* Boolean
* Null
* Array

#### Object
