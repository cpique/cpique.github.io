title: Where are we located in the Universe?

We have an address in the Universe. We are just a dot in the gigantestic cosmos, and we only know a part of it, so we are a dot in the part that we know of the cosmos.
The knowledge of the Earth location in the Universe has been built thanks to a 400 years of observations made with telescope.

Here is a high level description of where we are in the Universe:

### 1. Earth
Of course, all humans live in Earth. Until we don’t find a way to live in Mars, Venus or some moon, our future as a race depends on the wellbeing on the planet. 
Earth is the place where all humans beign were born. For now.

### 2. Solar System
The planetary system we are part of. As you probably already know, Earth and 7 others planets (and moons, comets, asteroids) spin in an orbit around the nearest star 
to us, the Sun.

### 3. Interestellar neighborhood. Local Interstellar Cloud
The Sun and a number of other stars are currently travelling in an Interstellar cloud of gas.
The cloud has a temperature of about 6,730 °C (7,000 K), about the same temperature as the surface of the Sun. Sounds scary.
Our Sun (our?) will remain in this cloud for another 10K to 20K years.
The closest star system to the solar system is Alpha Centauri, located 4.37 light years from the Sun. 
This means that at speed of light, it would take more than 4 years to travel from one star to the other. 
And, for the record, with the actual tecnology available it would take to us in a rough estimation 30000 years to reach the closest solar system to us. 
The closest star of the 400 billions of stars in the galaxy.

### 4. Milky way galaxy
Another term known for almost all of us. It is estimated that the spiral galaxy contains 200 to 400 billions stars. 
You can see part of it in an clear night sky with your own eyes.

### 5. Local Group
Our galaxy is not isolated. It moves around the cosmos with another galaxies, in a galaxy group called Local Group. 
The Local Group contains at least 47 galaxies.
It is dominated by 3 giant spiral galaxies, Andromeda, Milky Way and the Triangle Galaxy.
The rest of the galaxies are smaller and act as satellites of the three mentioned above.
The biggest galaxy in the Local Group is Andromeda, followed by our galaxy, the Milky Way.
Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.
Similar to the attraction Earth suffers from the sun, the small galaxies suffer attraction
from the greater ones, such as the Milky Way and Andromeda.
Scientists say that due to the constant expansion of the universe and our current technology, this is the limit we as a human beigns can reach
We will probably be always trap in the local group. It’s our limit, our boundary.
We can see beyond, but we can not travel to those places.

### 6. Virgo Supercluster
The supercluster of which the Local Group is a part.
It comprises roughly 100 galaxy groups and clusters, centred on the Virgo Cluster.
The Local Group is located on the outer edge of the Virgo Supercluster.
Is, in short, a mass concentration of galaxies.

### 7. Local Superclusters
In the same way that our galaxy is just one of many, the Virgo SuperCluster is only one from many superclusters. 
The closest neighbour of Virgo Supercluster is the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster.

### 8.  Observable Universe
It’s the part of the Cosmos whose light have had time to reach us.
Scientists can look around at a region of space that lies 13.8 billion light-years away. 
Astronomers on Earth can turn their telescopes to peer 13.8 billion light-years in every direction, which puts Earth inside of an observable sphere 
with a radius of 13.8 billion light-years. The sphere limits what scientists can see but not what is there.

### 9. Multiverse?
Beyond the observable universe, it’s all theories. One of the most popular says that our Universe is only one of an infinit number of universes.
The various universes within the multiverse are called “parallel universes”.
And due to this theory says that there are an infinite number of universes, one of them would be very similar than ours. 
Very similar, to the point that in that Universe you would have a different eye color, or a different job, with all the other things unchanged.

The dimension of the Universe is always a reminder of how small and unimportant we are.
