The purpose of this tutorial is give the reader an introduction to JSON.
It provides definitions, what are the parts of a JSON, how to build one, useful tools and examples.


### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
First of all, it's not a programming language. It's rather just text, written with JavaScript object notation.
It's a data-interchange format. A syntax for storing and exchanging data. All JSON files are built on two structures:
* A collection of key-value pairs
* A list of values which it's generally called as an array.

### Key benefits
* Easy to read and write by humans
* Easy to create and process by computers
* "Self-describing"
* Language independent (Can be read and used as a data format by any programming language)
* Can easily be sent to and from a server

### Syntax rules
* Data is in name/value pairs
* Data is separated by commas
* Curly braces hold objects
* Square brackets hold arrays

### Structures 
Valid data types to use in JSON:
* String (It must be written in double quotes)
* Number
* Object
* Boolean
* Null
* Array

#### Object
<p class="full-width"><img src="/public/image/2017-3-1-JSON_01.png" alt="Object example" /></p>

Begins with `{` and ends with `}`. Inside of these curly braces there are key/value pairs separated by a comma `,`.
Each pair at the same time is divided by a colon `:`.

#### Array
It's an ordered collection of values. It begins with a `[` and ends with `]` and its values are separated by a comma `,`.
Example of an array:
<p class="full-width"><img src="/public/image/2017-3-1-JSON_02.png" alt="Array example"/></p>

Note that the array above has different types of values (object, number, boolean ...).
The structures can be nested. This means that an object can have as one of its values another object or maybe an array, an array can have
another array inside of it, and so on.

### Examples 
[Here](https://goo.gl/Lw5tO2){:target="_blank"} you'll find real-life escenarios.

### JavaScript
`JSON.stringify()` & `JSON.parse()`

* `JSON.parse()` parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string.
A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server. When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.
Because of that, it's a common practice parsing the data with JSON.parse(), transforming the data into a JavaScript object.
<p class="full-width"><img src="/public/image/2017-3-1-JSON_03.png" alt="JSON parse utility"/></p>

* `JSON.stringify()` converts a JavaScript value to a JSON string.
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string.
Convert a JavaScript object into a string with JSON.stringify().
<p class="full-width"><img src="/public/image/2017-3-1-JSON_04.png" alt="JSON stringify utility"/></p>
The lines of codes above produce a string ready to be sent to a server.

### CSharp
JavaScriptSerializer `Deserialize()` and `Serialize()` to read and write to JSON files.
Create a empty web application with a unit test project.
In a class of the test project, paste the following code:

{% highlight csharp %}
[TestMethod]
public void TestDeserialize()
{
	string json = @"{""Data"":[{""ID"":""1"",""Name"":""Argentina""}, {""ID"":""2"",""Name"":""Brazil""}, {""ID"":""3"",""Name"":""Denmark""}, {""ID"":""4"",""Name"":""Italy""}]}";
	JavaScriptSerializer _js = new JavaScriptSerializer();
	Countries c = _js.Deserialize<Countries>(json);
	Assert.AreEqual(c.Data.Count, 4);
	Assert.AreEqual(c.Data[0].Name, "Argentina");
	Assert.AreEqual(c.Data[1].ID, 2);
}

[TestMethod]
public void TestSerialize()
{
	var response = new Response { Data = "Data to send to the client", IsSuccess = true, Message = "Ok" };
	JavaScriptSerializer _js = new JavaScriptSerializer();
	var responseSerialized = _js.Serialize(response);
	var responseDeserialized = _js.Deserialize<Response>(responseSerialized);
	Assert.IsTrue(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(responseSerialized));
	Assert.AreEqual(responseDeserialized.Data, response.Data);
	Assert.AreEqual(responseDeserialized.IsSuccess, response.IsSuccess);
	Assert.AreEqual(responseDeserialized.Message, response.Message);
}

public class Countries
{
	public List<Country> Data { get; set; } = new List<Country>();
}

public class Country
{
	public int ID { get; set; }
	public String Name { get; set; }
}

public class Response
{
	public object Data;
	public string Message { get; set; }
	public bool IsSuccess { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Use `Ctrl` + `.` in order to bring in the missing namespaces to the class. Compile and run the tests. You can debug them to see how the different variables are filled and how the methods described above behave.

### Online JSON formatters and validators

* [JSON Formatter and validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/){:target="_blank"} Allows you to validate json text indicating you whether it is valid or not. If it is valid, it will petty print your text. If not, it will inform you about the errors in the input.
* [Another JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/){:target="_blank"} Another formatter with validation. It has also different conversion options.
