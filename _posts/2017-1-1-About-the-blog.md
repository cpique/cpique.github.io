In this blog I’ll be posting one or two entries per month (at least that’s the idea) in Spanish or English indistinctly.
The topics you will find here are the ones I’m interested, from technology and software development to chess, soccer, languages and TV series. Could be anything, so feel free to use the tags to filter the information that you consider it’s not relevant and to focus in what you think it is.
