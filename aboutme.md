### More about me
I gratuated at Universidad Tecnológica Nacional in Rosario Argentina with a bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering. The most important teachings the university gave me are the ability to see things with a professional point of view and the capability to solve problems in an effective way as well as make good decisions under pressure. 
Since I graduated I'm more keen on the technical aspects of the field, that's why I take a lot of online courses to improve what I already know on websites like PluralSight, Microsoft MVA and Google and Android developers site.
I consider myself a self-learner person who always tries to be updated to keep up with new technologies and frameworks available. Althought I started with a web focus, now I'm an active learner of both the web and mobile worlds.
